This tool calculates the discordance between a firm's AI disclosure and its actual AI investment, allowing users to gauge whether the firm may be engaging in "AI washing" (overstating AI involvement) or "AI hushing" (understating AI involvement). The tool leverages NLP techniques to analyze disclosures from Excel files, along with employee data on AI skills.

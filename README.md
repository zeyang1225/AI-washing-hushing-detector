This tool calculates the discordance between a firm's AI disclosure and its actual AI investment, allowing users to gauge whether the firm may be engaging in "AI washing" (overstating AI involvement) or "AI hushing" (understating AI involvement). The tool leverages NLP techniques to analyze disclosures from earnings calls and annual reports, along with employee data about their AI skills.This code is actively maintained.
